> Tagline: কৰ্মদক্ষতাৰ শক্তি - নিবনুৱা বিদায় (Power of Skill, Goodbye to unemployment)

সংস্থাপনসেতু (SansthapanSetu) is a **Labour Management Information System (LMIS)** which provide a user friendly **platform for both employers and worker** to register and interact with each other. This platform allows **ground level workers** to find jobs in their domain, and employers to post jobs and recruit workers based on their need. Types of job include electrician, construction worker, painter, plumber, welder, carpenter etc.

**Got first position in an inter-hostel hackathon oraganised by Assam Engineering College:** This web app is developed based on a research performed by one of our team member in IIT Guwahati as a part of his internship. So, this is a basic prototype of the overall idea of the initiative. *The project is developed within one day and has not been modified after the hackathon.*
