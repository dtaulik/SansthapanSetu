        <div class="about-content">
            <p>The main objective of this Labour Management System project is to have a completely automated project
                allotment system which can even be managed by a non technical person. This project will serve the
                purpose of maintaining all the contractor and sub-contractor details along with issuing registration
                certificate to contractor and license certificate to sub-contractor. This Labour Management System
                project will definitely reduce the time and effort in searching for contractors with expired licenses
                and intimating them beforehand. Fetching all the contractor details, sub-contractor details and work
                order details will be made easy with just a single mouse click. Overall management of Contract labor
                will be easy and quick. Today, labours look for an labour-friendly environment where
                their ideas thrive, while the traditional work culture forces most-able labours to resign and look for
                another job due to low wages of the workers, more than 12 hours of working time etc.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>A labour management system provides labour productivity reporting and planning capabilities. The planning
            capabilities provide the ability to analyse workforce requirements given a certain amount of work to be
            performed and a standard unit of time to perform each element of work. Labor productivity planning
            capabilities provide the ability to measure and report the performance of individuals, groups or facilities
            vs. a predefined standard for performing each defined element of work.
            The software records the optimal time to carry out each task and compares it with actual performance.
            The software also stores the various information of the labours such their working experience, daily
            incomes, jobs done in past etc. The app can also record the attendance of the labours
        </p>
        <p>The idea is completely based on Labour Management Information System in which the data is synchronised and
            stored which can be used further as a record of the jobs done in past by the labours. Also this app will
            make the labours learn new techniques by using videos that are preloaded in the app.
            This app will help the labours as well as the employees as they can monitor the working hours of labours,
            tasks completed, assign different tasks to different labours, Daily payment records of labours etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Ideas and market opportunities that we plan to address in the application</h4>
